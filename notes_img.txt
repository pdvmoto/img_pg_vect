aim: 
0. store images (or path to images, or just filenames..)
1. convert pictures to vectors, get searchable vector data per img
2. find related images by vector-search

pip install PIL
pip install sentence_transformers 

pip install clip-server
pip install clip-client

may need also adjust path.. 
  WARNING: The script transformers-cli is installed in '/Users/pdvbv/Library/Python/3.9/bin' which is not on PATH.
  Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.

all sort of problems due to numPy v2, and modules encoded with V1..

notes on ora vs pg:
 - demo1_* scripts use to compare the two.
 - next find out what insert is needed for oracle + python?

notes on numpy:
 - cast to array.array ( "d", numpy.arr ) seemed to fix it.. grrr...

run first demo, pg:
 - re-create table : ct_img.sql
 - check contents of img-path, and load image (start with 2 similar and 1 diff)
 - python3 p2.py: load images.
 - \i demo2_pg.sql   : to see the similarities and differences.


run first demo oracle, same files as pg.
 - create tables: ct_vecimg.sql
 - python3 p3.py 
 - SQL> @demo2_ora.sql   : to see similarites + diff..
 - DEBUG... bcse outcomes are diff?
  - W/Out the input handler ? 
  - read back and verify ? 
  - do the cos-dist in python and store separately ?


Remarks..

After litteally DAYS of toil, I got it to work.
Two thing seemed to determine success.. 

1st, Not using the input-handler, but defining my own as :new_arr =  array.array( "d" numpy_arr)

2nd, Using old fashioned list of bind-vars as [], and not using :bindvar=localvar for vector-operations.


what further hindered me: 

3rd, use of "returning". I Really want to capture the new id, 
I've struggle with the "returning-clause in python and the cx_oracle as well: 
it never worked properly there, but it _seemed_ to work now. 
Only not when combined with any vector operation ? ? 

4th, I insisted on using numpy for vector-generation, 
spent too much time on trying to make ins/upd work with a numpy-array. 
(nice to know: the cos-similarity of vectors with numpy is Identical to the dbms_vector ones...)
